# Currency Converter App

This JavaScript file implements a basic currency converter web application. It fetches the latest currency exchange rates from a public API and allows users to convert amounts between different currencies.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Select the source currency and target currency from the dropdown menus.

3. Enter the amount you want to convert in the input field.

4. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted amount.

## Dependencies

- [Flags API](https://flagsapi.com): Used to display flag images based on selected currencies.
- [Currency API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api): Used to fetch the latest currency exchange rates.

## How it Works

- The application uses the Flags API to display flag images corresponding to the selected currencies.

- Exchange rates are fetched from the Currency API, and the converted amount is displayed to the user.

## Code Structure

- The main logic is implemented in the `app.js` file.

- The HTML structure is defined in the `index.html` file.

- Styling is provided in the `style.css` file.
